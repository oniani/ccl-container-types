% Abstract
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{abstract}
\noindent We present the type inference rules introducing the notion of
container types in the CCL programming language. This redesign required a
number of substantial changes to the major aspects of the language, including
the type system, the syntax, and the definitional semantics.
\end{abstract}

% The \subtype Relation
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{The $\subtype$ Relation}

\begin{gather}
  \inferrule{\type{}}{\type{Box(Triv)} \subtype \type{Box(Triv)}}\\
  \inferrule{\type{}}{\type{Box(Int)} \subtype \type{Box(Int)}}\\
  \inferrule{\type{T} \subtype \type{Box(U)}}{\type{T} \subtype \type{Immut(Box(U))}}\\
  \inferrule{\type{Box(T)} \subtype \type{Immut(U)}}{\type{Immut(Box(T))} \subtype \type{Immut(U)}}\\
  \inferrule{\type{T} \subtype \type{U} \\ \type{Box?(T)}}{\type{Ref\ T} \subtype \type{Ref\ U}}
\end{gather}

$\type{Box?}$ statement checks for both mutable and immutable containers.
In other words, $\type{Box(Int)}$ and $\type{Immut(Box(Int))}$ would both
satisfy the $\type{Box?}$ condition.

% The : Relation
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{The $\rtypeof$ and $\ltypeof$ Relations}

\begin{gather}
  \inferrule{\syntax{triv $\syntaxvar{x}$}}{\syntaxvar{x} \rtypeof \type{Triv}}\\
  \inferrule{\syntax{triv $\syntaxvar{x}$}}{\syntaxvar{x} \ltypeof \type{Box(Triv)}}\\
  \inferrule{\syntax{int $\syntaxvar{x}$}}{\syntaxvar{x} \rtypeof \type{Int}}\\
  \inferrule{\syntax{int $\syntaxvar{x}$}}{\syntaxvar{x} \ltypeof \type{Box(Int)}}\\
  \inferrule{\syntaxvar{x} \ltypeof \type{Box(T)}}{\syntax{immut}\ \syntaxvar{x} \ltypeof \type{Immut(Box(T))}}\\
  \inferrule{\syntaxvar{x} \ltypeof \type{T}}{\syntax{ref}\ \syntaxvar{x} \ltypeof \type{Box(Ref(T))}}\\
  \inferrule{\syntaxvar{x} \ltypeof \type{T}}{\syntax{\&}\ \syntaxvar{x} \rtypeof \type{Ref(T)}}\\
  \inferrule{\syntaxvar{x} \rtypeof \type{Ref(T)}}{\syntaxvar{x}\ \syntax{@} \rtypeof \type{T}}\\
  \inferrule{\syntaxvar{x} \rtypeof \type{Ref(T)}}{\syntaxvar{x}\ \syntax{@} \ltypeof \type{T}}\\
  \inferrule{\syntaxvar{x} \ltypeof \type{T} \\ \syntaxvar{y} \ltypeof \type{U} \\ \type{T} \subtype \type{U} \\ \syntaxvar{x} \rtypeof \type{V}}{\syntaxvar{x}\ \syntax{:=}\ \syntaxvar{y} \rtypeof \type{V}}
\end{gather}

$\syntax{x} : \type{T}$ is read as ``expression \syntax{x} is of type
$\type{T}$ and is in an \textit{r-context}.''

$\syntax{x} :: \type{T}$ is read as ``variable \syntax{x} is of type $\type{T}$
and is in an \textit{l-context}.''

The operators could also be referred to as the ``r-type of'' and ``l-type of''
operators.

\medskip

l-context denotes everything that is \textit{assignable} (indicated as a
storable memory).\ r-context, on the other hand, denotes everything that is
\textit{expressible} (can be produced by an expression).

\medskip

There is no r-value (e.g.\ expression) of the type $\type{Box(T)}$.

\medskip

We omit rules for $\type{Con}$ types as they only operate on r-values.

\medskip

We omit rules for $\type{Fun}$ types as they only accept r-values.
Any variable and/or primitive type has both r-value and l-value (when it comes
to primitive types, only r-value). In all cases, the r-value part of the actual
parameter is passed when the function is being called.

% Basic Rules

\section*{Resulting Relationships (A Short List)}

\begin{align*}
  &\syntax{int i}                    &&\to i    &&\to \type{Box(Int)}\\
  &\syntax{immut int ii}             &&\to ii   &&\to \type{Immut(Box(Int))}\\
  &\syntax{ref int ri}               &&\to ri   &&\to \type{Box(Ref(Box(Int)))}\\
  &\syntax{immut ref int iri}        &&\to iri  &&\to \type{Immut(Box(Ref(Box(Int))))}\\
  &\syntax{ref immut int rii}        &&\to rii  &&\to \type{Box(Ref((Immut(Box(Int)))))}\\
  &\syntax{immut ref immut int irii} &&\to irii &&\to \type{Immut(Box(Ref((Immut(Box(Int))))))}
\end{align*}

\medskip

Type $\type{Immut\ Box(Immut\ Box(Int))}$ cannot exist. Nested $\type{Box}$
types are only possible when there is at least one $\type{Ref}$ type.

\begin{gather*}
  \type{Box(Triv)}        \subtype \type{Box(Triv)}\\
  \type{Box(Int)}         \subtype \type{Box(Int)}\\
  \type{Box(Triv)}        \subtype \type{Immut(Box(Triv))}\\
  \type{Box(Int)}         \subtype \type{Immut(Box(Int))}\\
  \type{Immut(Box(Triv))} \subtype \type{Immut(Box(Triv))}\\
  \type{Immut(Box(Int))}  \subtype \type{Immut(Box(Int))}
\end{gather*}

\medskip

All the rules above should work with $\type{Ref}$ types in the similar manner:

\begin{gather*}
  \type{Ref(Box(Triv))}        \subtype \type{Ref(Box(Triv))}\\
  \type{Ref(Box(Int))}         \subtype \type{Ref(Box(Int))}\\
  \type{Ref(Box(Triv))}        \subtype \type{Ref(Immut(Box(Triv)))}\\
  \type{Ref(Box(Int))}         \subtype \type{Ref(Immut(Box(Int)))}\\
  \type{Ref(Immut(Box(Triv)))} \subtype \type{Ref(Immut(Box(Triv)))}\\
  \type{Ref(Immut(Box(Int)))}  \subtype \type{Ref(Immut(Box(Int)))}
\end{gather*}
