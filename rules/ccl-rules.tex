$\syntax{x} : \type{T}$ is read as ``expression \syntax{x} is of type
$\type{T}$ and is in an \textit{r-context}.''

$\syntax{x} :: \type{T}$ is read as ``variable \syntax{x} is of type $\type{T}$
and is in an \textit{l-context}.''

The operators could also be referred to as the ``r-type of'' and ``l-type of''
operators.

\medskip

l-context denotes everything that is \textit{assignable} (indicated as a
storable memory).\ r-context, on the other hand, denotes everything that is

\medskip

There is no r-value (e.g.\ expression) of the type $\type{Box(T)}$.

\medskip

For now, we omit rules for $\type{Con}$ types as they only operate on r-values.

\medskip

For now, we omit rules for $\type{Fun}$ types as they only accept r-values.
Any variable and/or primitive type has both r-value and l-value (when it comes
to primitive types, only r-value). In all cases, the r-value part of the actual
parameter is passed when the function is being called.
