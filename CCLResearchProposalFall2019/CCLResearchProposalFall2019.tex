\maketitle

The extension of an existing programming language through the addition of
additional “features” is a process fraught with potential problems.
Additional features must be integrated smoothly into the existing language
framework at the syntactic and semantic levels and this invariably requires
a thorough (re)analysis of many aspects of the programming language, including
the syntax, the type system, the definitional semantics, the intermediate
representation, and the runtime model.

\bigskip

In this project, I will analyze an existing experimental programming language,
propose extensions that substantially and meaningfully extend the capabilities
of the language (including the introduction of aggregate types and object-oriented
features into this non-objected-oriented language), and integrate these changes
into the scanner, parser, typechecker, code generator, and definitional
interpreter for the language. The necessary work will require both theoretical
work with the mathematicological aspects of the language's specification and
practical work with the existing processors for the language.
