\section*{The $\rtypeof$ and $\ltypeof$ Relations}

\begin{gather}
  \inferrule{\syntax{triv x}}{\syntax{x} \rtypeof \type{Triv}}\\
  \inferrule{\syntax{triv x}}{\syntax{x} \ltypeof \type{Box(Triv)}}\\
  \inferrule{\syntax{int x}}{\syntax{x} \rtypeof \type{Int}}\\
  \inferrule{\syntax{int x}}{\syntax{x} \ltypeof \type{Box(Int)}}\\
  \inferrule{\syntaxvar{x} \ltypeof \type{Box(T)}}{\syntax{immut}\ \syntaxvar{x} \ltypeof \type{IBox(T)}}\\
  \inferrule{\syntaxvar{x} \ltypeof \type{T}}{\syntax{ref}\ \syntaxvar{x} \ltypeof \type{Box(Ref(T))}}\\
  \inferrule{\syntaxvar{x} \ltypeof \type{T}}{\syntax{\&}\ \syntaxvar{x} \rtypeof \type{Ref(T)}}\\
  \inferrule{\syntaxvar{x} \rtypeof \type{Ref(T)}}{\syntaxvar{x}\ \syntax{@} \rtypeof \type{T}}\\
  \inferrule{\syntaxvar{x} \rtypeof \type{Ref(T)}}{\syntaxvar{x}\ \syntax{@} \ltypeof \type{T}}\\
  \inferrule{\syntaxvar{x} \ltypeof \type{T} \\ \syntaxvar{y} \ltypeof \type{U} \\ \type{T} \contsubtype \type{U} \\ \syntaxvar{x} \rtypeof \type{V}}{\syntaxvar{x}\ \syntax{:=}\ \syntaxvar{y} \rtypeof \type{V}}
\end{gather}

$\syntax{x} : \type{T}$ is read as ``expression \syntax{x} is of type
$\type{T}$ and is in an \textit{r-context}.''

$\syntax{x} :: \type{T}$ is read as ``variable \syntax{x} is of type $\type{T}$
and is in an \textit{l-context}.''

The operators could also be referred to as the ``r-type of'' and ``l-type of''
operators.

\medskip

l-context denotes everything that is \textit{assignable} (indicated as a
storable memory).\ r-context, on the other hand, denotes everything that is
\textit{expressible} (can be produced by an expression).

\medskip

There is no r-value (e.g.\ expression) of the type $\type{Box(T)}$.

\medskip

We omit rules for $\type{Con}$ types as they only operate on r-values.

\medskip

We omit rules for $\type{Fun}$ types as they only accept r-values.
Any variable and/or primitive type has both r-value and l-value (when it comes
to primitive types, only r-value). In all cases, the r-value part of the actual
parameter is passed when the function is being called.

% The \subtype Relation
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{The $\contsubtype$ Relation}

\begin{gather}
  \inferrule{\type{}}{\type{Box(Triv)} \contsubtype \type{Box(Triv)}}\\
  \inferrule{\type{}}{\type{Box(Int)} \contsubtype \type{Box(Int)}}\\
  \inferrule{\type{T} \contsubtype \type{Box(U)}}{\type{T} \contsubtype \type{IBox(U)}}\\
  \inferrule{\type{Box(T)} \contsubtype \type{IBox(U)}}{\type{IBox(T)} \contsubtype \type{IBox(U)}}\\
  \inferrule{\type{T} \contsubtype \type{U}}{\type{Ref\ T} \contsubtype \type{Ref\ U}}
\end{gather}

$\contsubtype$ specifies the relationship between two container types.

\medskip

$\type{Box?}$ statement checks for both mutable and immutable containers.
In other words, $\type{Box(Int)}$ and $\type{IBox(Int)}$ would both
satisfy the $\type{Box?}$ condition.
